This repository contains code downloaded from https://www.fourmilab.ch/homeplanet/download/3.3a/hp_source.zip. Therefore, you may consider this repository a mirror of the original source code, under public domain according to the original terms set out on the Fourmilab website.
> Experienced C programmers who wish to modify Home Planet or simply look under the hood to see how it works may download the source code. You're welcome to use this source code in any way you like, but it is absolutely unsupported—you are entirely on your own. Note that the bitmaps included in the source code archive are reduced resolution and colour gamut images prepared expressly for Home Planet. If you're looking for cloudless Earth images for other applications, you're better off starting with the higher resolution, 24 bit per pixel images available from the NASA Earth Observatory site.
